# 11th Hsinchu X Meichu Hackathon
# NXP - Intelligent Temperature Control System for Trains

## Introduction
Using an NXP development board and an external camera, simulate a camera inside the carriage to capture images. Process these images through YOLO object detection to determine the number of people in the carriage dynamically. Adjust the temperature of the carriage's air conditioning based on the detected occupancy to achieve a balance between energy efficiency and comfort. Display the passenger count for each carriage segment on a web interface, providing passengers at stations with information about the occupancy status.
